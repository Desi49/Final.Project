<h3>The Exorcist is a horror movie classic but with every good movie they had some compilcations. For example Ellen Burstyn received a permanent spinal injury during filming. In the sequence where she is thrown away from her possessed daughter, a harness jerked her hard away from the bed. She fell on her coccyx and screamed in pain this was caught on film and adds to the realism of that scene.</h3>   
<h2>Here are some other facts:</h2>
    
 <ul>
     <h3> <li>Due to death threats against Linda Blair from religious zealots who believed the film “glorified Satan”, Warner Bros. had bodyguards protecting her for six months after the film’s release.</li>
<li>Actors Jack MacGowran (who played Burke Dennings) and Vasiliki Maliaros (Father Karras’ Mother) died before the film was released.
    Even though the book was best sellers every hollywood studio had rejected the screenplay except for Warner Bros. Studio.</li>
 <li>Adurey Hepburn and Jane Fonda both turned down the role for Chris MacNeil.</li>
         <li>The Orginal trailer for the film was banned from several theaters for being "To Frighting"</li></h3>
