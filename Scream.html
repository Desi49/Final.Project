          <h2>Scream is a odd but yet every entertaining horror movie.Its also one of my favorites horror movies. Scream has a lot of turns when it comes to the  murderer and there are certain rules you must follow when in a horror movie here are the basics:</h2>
         <ol>
         <li>Never have sex. Sex = Death</li>
         <li>Never go anywhere alone</li>
         <li>Never Drink or do Drugs</li>
         <li>Never under any circumstances say,"i'll be right back"</li>         
         </ol>
<p>Follow these rules and you should suruvive the first movie now if we're talking sqeuals thats a whole new game. The rules change for trilogies as well now if we have a forth movie its most likely a new generation so there will be new rules.  </p>
